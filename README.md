## Project Overview
This is a simple web-based calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator features a clean, responsive user interface with a grid layout for buttons and a display screen for input and results.

- Clear button (C) to reset the calculator.
- Error handling for invalid expressions.
- Responsive design with hover effects on buttons for better user interaction.
- Styled with a modern look using CSS (box-shadow, grid layout, and vibrant colors).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure of the calculator.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including grid layout, hover effects, and responsive design.
